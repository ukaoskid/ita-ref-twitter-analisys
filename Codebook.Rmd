### Introduction
Twitter data collection for Italian Referendum Vote Day.
This study has to be intended for a experimental purpose

#### Prerequisites

- Taking tweets by geolocation filtering and hashtag filtering
    1. Negative opinion `#IoVotoNO, #BastaUnNO, #IoDicoNO, #VotaNO`
    2. Positive opinion `#IoVotoSI, #BastaUnSI, #IoDicoSI, #VotaSI, #IoVotoSì, #BastaUnSì, #IoDicoSì, #VotaSì`
- Geolocation granularity minimum level is Metropolitan City
- Positive and negative meaning hastags cannot coexsists in the same tweet
- User are grouped simulating one vote

#### Output data for YES and NO
- Daily heatmap and total heatmap
- Daily mean trend
- % of active users on topic
- % of passive users on topic

The study will underline also unconfident users with this social network
- % of uncomplete profiles
- % of incorrect/deceiptive profiles

### Geopolitic subdivision
Statistic is distributed with a level of granularity following this order of dimensions
- Metropolitan City
- Big Area
- Geographic district
- Nation

#### Subdivision Masterdata
Geopolitic subdivision is took from ISTAT (Italian National Institute of Statistics)
- http://www.istat.it
- Population data is referring the last Census survey (2014)

### Poll results
#### Preface
The data observation time-frame started from November, 3rd 2016 and ended on November, 23th 2016. To make this analisys clear and transparent we have to put some notes on top of the charts, in order to read data in the proper way:

- Tweets sample: **`r nrow(tweets_global)`**
- User sample: **`r nrow(global_users)`**
- Italian internet users are the `65.6%` of the population (source is WorldBank.org: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.P2?locations=IT);
- Only the `5.7%` (dataset da aggiungere) of the Italian internet users are really active on Twitter. Given that, we can continue to say that "this is, however, a good sample to consider", but we cannot say that it is representative of the whole nation;
- The analisys in topic has an experimental purpose and it is only representing the orientation of the Italian Twitter users;
- The analisys is not making any kind of propaganda. These are scientific data.

#### Points involved in Referendum
Unfortunately for not-Italian people, the reform's original text is in Italian, but a Wikipedia page is present and summarizes the purpose also in English:
